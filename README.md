## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript

Codewar challenges composed of 7kyus and 8kyus solved every day! 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I look at other peoples solutions to broaden the perspective of solving a same problem, and to optimize them. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that there are countless solutions to tackle the same problems and that sometimes you have to think about the edge cases in order for your solutions to fully work.
